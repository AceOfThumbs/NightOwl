# NightOwl

NightOwl is a static circadian rhythm planner built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The `gh-pages` branch hosts the production build so it can be served directly from GitHub Pages without any additional tooling.

The app now includes a Ko-Fi support button, rendered inline in the header so it stays visible without covering other content.
